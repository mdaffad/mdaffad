### Hey there! I'm Daffa ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building reliable systems, exploring distributed architectures, and contributing to open source whenever I can.

I usually work with Python, Go, Docker, and anything involving APIs, messaging, or real-time data.

---

ðŸ›  **Things Iâ€™m into:**  
- Backend development (FastAPI, Django, Go, etc.)  
- Streaming & messaging systems (Kafka, MQTT, WebRTC)  
- Infra stuff (Container, Orchestrator, CI/CD, eBPF)  
- edge devices and data pipelines  

---

ðŸŒ± I contribute to open source because I genuinely enjoy it.  
If you're working on something cool and need helpâ€”or looking for a maintainerâ€”I'm open to chatting!
